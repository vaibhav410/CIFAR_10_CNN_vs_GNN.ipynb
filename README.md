# CIFAR_10_CNN_vs_GNN.ipynb
This project compares the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset

Project Overview:-

Implemented CNN and GNN models in Python
Trained both models on CIFAR-10
Compared accuracy, loss, and training time
Goal: understand how image data behaves in grid (CNN) vs graph (GNN) form


Technologies Used:-

1.Python

2.PyTorch / PyTorch Geometric

3.CIFAR-10 Dataset

4.Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Open the notebook and run all cells.
