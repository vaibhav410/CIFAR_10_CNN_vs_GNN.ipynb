# CIFAR_10_CNN_vs_GNN.ipynb
This project compares the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset

Project Overview

Implemented CNN and GNN models in Python

Trained both models on CIFAR-10

Compared accuracy, loss, and training time

Goal: understand how image data behaves in grid (CNN) vs graph (GNN) form


Technologies Used

Python

PyTorch / PyTorch Geometric

CIFAR-10 Dataset

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
